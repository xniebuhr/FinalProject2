# Hangman
This project is a Python application built with PyQt6, developed as the second half of my final project for my Intro to CS II class. The game follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and features variable difficulty levels, a visual display of remaining guesses, and the tracking of the playerâ€™s best score. The PyQt6 framework
provides an interactive graphical user interface, making the game engaging and user-friendly.

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in GUI development with PyQt6, implementing the MVC design pattern, and managing event-driven programming. I also strengthened my ability to structure clean, modular code, handle user interactions efficiently, and integrate game logic into a professional software architecture.
